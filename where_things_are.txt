* Adding email addresses works, as long as the "secondary email address" and "quota" are blank strings.
  Otherwise, gets "domain not found" on import.

* No matter what, the password doesn't work when the user tries to log in. The admin can change the password from modoboa, but when the user logs in they'll see a message in Czech that says "clipboard required".

So not quite a disaster, but close.
